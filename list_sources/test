I am a musician. It has been more than 40 or 50 years since I had started
to play the guitar.
I also sing as well as playing it, mostly electric.
I have played for more than 45 years.
Nowadays, acostic may be back to my favorite.
I sixty-six still hava a dream to get a big time.
Hey men! What's wrong!
